# Dequeue
In computer science, a double-ended queue (abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements 
can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).

This repository consists of a flexible Dequeue, a input restricted Deque and a output restricted Deque
1) In flexible Dequeue, Input can be inserted from left as well as right end and same is the case of deletion
2) In input restricted Dequeue, Input can be inserted only one end but deletions can occur from both ends
3) In output restricted Dequeue, Input can be inserted from both ends but deletion can occur only from one end.
